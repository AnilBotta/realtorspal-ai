The AI engineer successfully initiated development by cloning the  GitHub repository and adapting to a discrepancy between the system's initial project structure and the actual repo's layout. It established a full-stack MVP, building a FastAPI backend with MongoDB and a React frontend, while adhering to strict environment constraints like  routing and environment variable usage. Key achievements include implementing core CRM features (lead management, analytics, settings), integrating a placeholder for LLM chat, and iteratively enhancing the UI/UX with Kanban boards, advanced forms, search/filter capabilities, and bulk import functionality. The engineer demonstrated strong problem-solving by diagnosing and fixing critical issues such as  incompatibility, frontend routing errors, and MongoDB index conflicts, often re-summarizing progress and seeking explicit user approval for next phases. The process has been highly iterative, adding significant functionality and design polish.

<product_requirements>
The user initially requested to clone the  GitHub repository from the main branch and make the application live and responsive. Subsequent clarifications and feature requests defined the application as:

*   **Core Stack:** React frontend, FastAPI backend, MongoDB database.
*   **Branding:** App name RealtorsPal AI with an emerald color theme.
*   **Authentication:** Initially demo login (email: , password: ), later switched to an auto-demo session due to persistent login issues, with re-implementation planned for later.
*   **LLM Integration:** Provide UI for entering LLM API keys (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini) in Settings, and integrate LLM functionality using Emergent LLM keys for testing, or user-provided keys for chat ().

    *   **Dashboard:** Display KPIs and a Kanban board for leads (with drag-and-drop, Add Lead, Lead Details).
    *   **Leads Tab:** A list/table view showing all lead fields (first/last name, email, phone, property type, location, budget, priority, tags, stage). Includes search, filter (by stage, dashboard inclusion, priority, property, location, budget), Add Lead modal, and Import Lead modal.
    *   **Lead Actions:** Per-row actions in the Leads list: Add to Dashboard (sets  flag), Edit (via ), Delete.
    *   **Add Lead Modal:** Comprehensive form with inline validation for email, strict E.164 phone format, property type, budget ranges, preferred locations, and tags.
    *   **Lead Details Drawer:** For viewing, editing, and deleting a lead's full details.
    *   **Import Leads:** Button to import leads from CSV and Excel files, including a field-mapping step, default stage selection, and Add to Dashboard toggle. Placeholder for Google Drive/Sheets.
*   **Analytics:** Dashboard to show lead pipeline, conversion funnel, and other KPIs.
*   **Agent Config:** UI for configuring AI agents (behavior, prompts, AI model).
*   **Deployment:** App to be deployed and runnable in the provided Kubernetes container environment, using supervisor for service management. All backend API routes must be prefixed with .

<current_work>
The application, RealtorsPal AI, is a functional full-stack CRM. The backend is built with FastAPI, using MongoDB for data storage, and the frontend is a React application with a Tailwind CSS-based emerald theme.

**Current State of Backend:**
The backend () is fully operational. It manages user settings, lead data, and basic analytics. The database schema for leads is comprehensive, including , ,  (optional but unique if provided),  (E.164 validated), , , , , , , , , and  (a boolean flag to control visibility on the Dashboard Kanban). An automatic demo session is enabled () to bypass login, creating or retrieving a demo user ( / ). The backend handles lead creation, retrieval, stage updates, deletion, and bulk import () for CSV/Excel files, with robust validation and duplicate email handling. It also provides a placeholder LLM chat endpoint () wired to use  and fallback to  if user-provided keys are absent, though full SDK functionality is pending.  version has been pinned to ensure compatibility.

**Current State of Frontend:**
The React frontend is styled with an emerald theme using Tailwind CSS. Upon loading, it automatically initializes a demo session. The application features a main navigation bar with the following pages:
*   **Dashboard ():** Displays KPIs and a functional Kanban board for leads with drag-and-drop capabilities. Leads shown here are filtered to those with . It includes an Add Lead button that opens  and clicking a card opens .
*   **Leads ():** Presents leads in a searchable and filterable table format. It features:
    *   A search bar that queries across all lead fields.
    *   A filter panel to refine leads by stage, dashboard inclusion, priority, property type, location, and budget range.
    *   An Add Lead button which opens  where new leads are created with  by default.
    *   An Import button which opens  for bulk importing leads from CSV or Excel files, with field mapping and a results summary.
    *   Per-row actions: Add to Dashboard (moves lead to Dashboard Kanban), Edit (opens ), and Delete.
*   **Add Lead Modal ():** A sophisticated form for adding new leads, featuring separate fields for first/last name, optional email, phone with strict E.164 auto-normalization and inline validation, dropdowns for property type, budget range (with presets and custom option), preferred location, and dynamic tags (defaults to Manual). The save button is always enabled but performs validation on submission.
*   **Lead Details Drawer ():** Accessed by clicking a lead card on the Dashboard or a lead row in the Leads tab. It allows viewing, editing all lead fields with inline validation, and deleting the lead.
*   **Analytics ():** Displays a KPI grid and a conversion funnel bar chart.
*   **Settings ():** Allows users to input and save their OpenAI, Anthropic, or Gemini API keys, which are persisted in the backend.
*   **Agent Config ():** Provides a UI for configuring AI agents, including prompt editing.

The frontend uses  for API calls, ensuring all requests are correctly prefixed with  and dynamically target  for robust communication.
