<analysis>
The previous AI engineer effectively transitioned the RealtorsPal AI CRM from an MVP to a robust application. The work stream began by stabilizing core lead management, then expanded significantly to include advanced Twilio WebRTC communication and comprehensive SMTP email with LLM drafting capabilities. Following this, a major lead management overhaul was undertaken, introducing an expanded lead model, a tabbed , and dynamic custom fields. The provided trajectory details the subsequent refinement of pipeline options, which evolved into a complete redesign of the Leads page to a professional table format. Interspersed with these feature additions were critical bug fixes for form input, data synchronization, and layout issues. The final significant implementation was a sophisticated global search and filter template system, dramatically enhancing lead targeting and application-wide search functionality, bringing the CRM to a highly advanced and production-ready state.

<product_requirements>
The RealtorsPal AI CRM, built with React, FastAPI, and MongoDB, aims to be a live, responsive application with a modern emerald theme. It provides core lead management through a Kanban dashboard with KPIs, drag-and-drop functionality, and comprehensive lead creation/import. It also features LLM integration for various tasks.

Recent feature enhancements include:
1.  **Twilio Communication**: Full WebRTC calling, SMS, and WhatsApp integration from lead cards, configured via Twilio API keys and custom TwiML.
2.  **SMTP Email Integration**: SMTP configuration in settings, an Email modal for LLM-powered drafting (using Emergent LLM Key) with templates/tones, and email history.
3.  **Comprehensive Lead Management**:
    *   Expanded  model with over 37 new fields.
    *   Tabbed  for creating/editing leads.
    *    for dynamic custom field creation.
    *   Redesigned  page from card/list to a professional table format.

    *   Real-time Kanban card movement based on pipeline status changes.
    *   Call and SMS buttons in the Leads table to open existing communication modals.
    *   Selective Add to Dashboard / Remove from Dashboard functionality for leads.
4.  **Advanced Filtering**: Global search functionality across the entire application and a comprehensive filter template system with quick action buttons, smart primary filters (Temperature, Budget, Timeline), and an expandable advanced panel.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer successfully implemented a comprehensive global search and advanced filter template system. This involved:
1.  **Global Search ()**: A new component providing an app-wide search modal, integrated into the main navigation header (). It allows searching across all lead data.
2.  **Filter Templates ()**: A new component allowing users to build, save, and apply custom filter combinations. It features:
    *   A modal with Create Template and Saved Templates tabs.
    *   A left panel listing 59 detailed filter options across categories like Communication, Pipeline, Lead Details, etc.
    *   A right panel (Template Builder) for naming and managing selected filters.
    *   Action buttons: Clear Filters, Apply and Preview, Save as New.
This system was integrated into the main navigation header and the Leads page, replacing basic filters. Testing confirmed all components (search box, quick action buttons, smart filters, advanced panel, filter templates modal, and its sub-features) are working as requested, providing a sophisticated filtering and search experience.

<optional_next_step>
The global search and filter template system is fully implemented and working. I will ask the user for any further refinements or enhancements.
