# Backend Testing Results

## Lead Import Functionality Testing

### Test Summary
All lead import functionality tests have been successfully completed and are working correctly.

### Tests Performed

#### 1. Basic Import with Valid Data ✅
- **Status**: PASSED
- **Description**: Tested importing 2 leads with complete valid data including names, emails, phone numbers, property details, and pricing information
- **Result**: Successfully imported 2 leads with all fields correctly stored
- **Verification**: Confirmed proper response structure with `inserted: 2`, `skipped: 0`, and populated `inserted_leads` array

#### 2. Phone Number Normalization ✅
- **Status**: PASSED  
- **Description**: Tested importing leads with phone numbers requiring normalization (without + prefix)
- **Test Cases**:
  - "13654578956" (11-digit US number) → normalized to "+13654578956"
  - "4155551111" (10-digit US number) → normalized to "+14155551111"
- **Result**: Phone numbers correctly normalized to E.164 format
- **Verification**: Confirmed all returned phone numbers start with "+1" prefix

#### 3. Duplicate Email Handling ✅
- **Status**: PASSED
- **Description**: Tested system behavior when importing leads with duplicate email addresses
- **Process**: 
  1. Successfully imported initial lead with unique email
  2. Attempted to import second lead with same email address
- **Result**: System correctly handled duplicate by skipping the second lead
- **Response**: `inserted: 0`, `skipped: 1`, with proper error message "duplicate email for this user"

#### 4. Invalid Data Validation ✅
- **Status**: PASSED
- **Description**: Tested system validation with invalid email format
- **Test Case**: Attempted to import lead with email "not-an-email" (invalid format)
- **Result**: System correctly returned HTTP 422 validation error
- **Verification**: Proper error handling prevents invalid data from being stored

### API Endpoint Verification
- **Endpoint**: `/api/leads/import`
- **Method**: POST
- **Authentication**: Demo user session working correctly
- **Response Format**: Confirmed proper ImportResult structure with `inserted`, `skipped`, `errors`, and `inserted_leads` fields

### Key Findings
1. **Phone Normalization**: The `normalize_phone()` function correctly handles various US phone number formats
2. **Duplicate Prevention**: MongoDB unique index on `(user_id, email)` effectively prevents duplicate emails per user
3. **Error Handling**: System provides clear error messages for both validation failures and business rule violations
4. **Data Integrity**: All imported leads maintain proper field mapping and data types
5. **Response Structure**: API returns comprehensive results including both summary counts and detailed lead objects

### Backend System Health
