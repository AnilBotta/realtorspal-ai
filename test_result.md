### Key Findings
1. **Backend API Functionality**: All WebRTC-related backend endpoints are working correctly and returning proper responses
2. **Error Handling**: Backend properly handles missing credentials with clear error messages and setup instructions
3. **Response Format**: All endpoints return appropriate JSON/XML responses with correct status codes
4. **TwiML Generation**: TwiML endpoints generate valid XML for Twilio voice operations
5. **Setup Detection**: Backend correctly identifies when Twilio credentials are not configured and provides setup_required responses

### Root Cause Analysis
**The "Initializing..." issue is NOT in the backend**. The backend APIs are functioning correctly and returning proper responses:
- When credentials are missing: Returns `"status": "setup_required"` or `"status": "error"` with `"setup_required": true`
- When credentials are valid: Would return `"status": "success"` with access tokens
- TwiML endpoints return valid XML responses

**The issue is likely in the frontend WebRTC interface** that is not properly handling these backend responses to transition from "Initializing..." to either "Setup Required" or "Ready" state.

### Recommendations for Main Agent
1. **Frontend Investigation**: Check the WebRTC interface component that handles the initialization process
2. **Response Handling**: Verify that the frontend properly processes the `setup_required` status from the backend
3. **State Management**: Ensure the frontend state machine transitions correctly based on backend responses
4. **Error Display**: Confirm that setup instructions are displayed when `setup_required` is received
