# RealtorsPal AI - Current Issue: Data Isolation

## 🚨 CURRENT ISSUE: Demo Data for New Users

**Problem**: New users are seeing demo data instead of their own empty dashboard/data
**Status**: Needs immediate fix
**Impact**: Users cannot see their actual data - shows demo metrics and leads

## 🔧 REQUIRED FIXES

### 1. Backend Data Filtering
- ✅ Backend endpoints need to filter by authenticated user ID
- ✅ Remove hardcoded demo data responses
- ✅ Ensure all queries include user_id filtering

### 2. Frontend Demo Mode Detection
- ✅ Remove hardcoded demo mode banner
- ✅ Update dashboard to show real user data
- ✅ Handle empty state properly for new users

### 3. Database User Association
- ✅ Ensure all data tables have user_id relationships
- ✅ Verify user-specific data isolation

## 🎯 EXPECTED BEHAVIOR

**For New Users**:
- Empty dashboard with 0 leads, 0 conversations, etc.
- No demo mode banner
- Ability to add their own leads
- User-specific data only

**For Existing Users**:
- See only their own data
- No crossover between user accounts
- Proper data isolation

## 🚀 DEPLOYMENT STATUS

✅ **Application Deployed**: http://172.234.26.134
✅ **Backend Working**: API endpoints responding
✅ **Frontend Working**: Login and interface functional
❌ **Data Isolation**: Still showing demo data for all users

## 📋 NEXT STEPS

1. Fix backend API endpoints to filter by user
2. Update frontend to remove demo mode
3. Test with multiple user accounts
4. Verify data isolation works properly
5. Push fixes to GitHub and update deployment
